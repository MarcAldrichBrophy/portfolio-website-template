# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

# Seattle University Students

This project is intended for students to start thinking about creating their personal portfolio websites. Websites like these will allow employers to read beyond what you put in your resume.

Additionally, this project is part of the AWS Cloud Coalition lab, where we deploy this website onto the cloud using Elastic Beanstalk.

# Advanced Students

To make deployment easier, node_modules has been included. If you're an advanced user and would like to fork this repository in order to work on it yourself, feel free to delete the node_modules folder. Additionally, uncomment node_modes from the .gitignore file.

For rapid deployment to Elastic Beanstalk, consider researching AWS Code Pipeline, and attach your repository to your Elastic Beanstalk environment. Every sync to your source repository will trigger your website to live update.
